- Launch "Unity Remote 5" on your phone.
- Click play.
- When Unity is connected to your phone, touch the screen and rotate your phone.
- You will see the camera rotate with your phone's orientation. (It's possible that your phone does not have an orientation sensor, in which case your only solution is to change your phone to another phone.)
- Click on "Start Recording" in the Camera Mocap script.
- When you're done capturing your animation, click on "Stop Recording".
- Your animation will be saved in the "Assets/Camera_Mocap/Mocap_Export/" folder. You can place it on the camera and watch it again.

Camera motion capture is a feature that a lot of indie game devs overlook, but it can really enhance a game's appeal. For example, check out "Inside", a video game by Playdead studio, to see how good camera movement can create a realistic feeling. You can achieve this by using this script and capturing your phone's movement.

like a real camera, but in your game.

It can also be used for camera shake animation, like when something explodes in the game and you need a realistic animation for shaking the camera.
